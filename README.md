# Drawing & Zodiac Profile App

A single-page web application where users can create drawings, enter some information and it automatically derives their chinese zodiac and age. Think of it as like art you put on a fridge.

## Important Note
OnRender does not seem to like loading my website due to the scripts I have loaded in order to allow for drawing on the canvas. If required, I can demonstrate my application to a TA or the professor in person.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single page application that updates dynamically on user submissions and data deletion, and edits. When user submits, edits, or deletes data, the page will essentially rerender with the updated data.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: In addition to deleting existing data, users can also edit existing data. Unfortuantely it was extremely difficult to figure out how to get the image data to function properly with my site and I decided to pause that. Sometimes art does not need to be perfect but you gotta make sure your name is right!

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
- Student 1:
  - Bonavita
  - Issues with design : Delete button and edit button should have more information. It was not clear what they did at first glance.
  - Surprising comment: I was surpised when they said nothing came up when they clicked submit, and eventually my onrender site crashed.
  - Changes: I would definitely add some kind of icon to the buttons. Like a pencil for edit and X for delete.
- Student 2: Dignan
  - Issues with design: Did not realize they needed to enter birthday and resulted in a null submission for age at first.
  - Surprising comment: I was surprised when they commented on the cross-hair cursor. I did not realize it can be hard to see the cursor on a larger monitor.
  - changes: I should definitely add entry checks and change how the cursor looks to be more visible.
